### On the difference between "typical" and "normalized" coverage
<details>
<summary><i>Me</i></summary>
<br />

+ Right now, I have a script that generates "normalized coverage" as described in the siQ-ChIP Sci Rep 2023 paper:
    > This projection of bulk concentration to genomic location is valid if, and only if, $\frac{1}{\hat{R}} \sum_{x} f(x) = 1$.
    > 
    > When the track $f(x)$ is built, each fragment can be counted only once so that $\frac{1}{\hat{R}}$ normalizes $f(x)$. We suggest that $f(x)$ be referred to as the 'normalized coverage'.
+ Some more details for the above bullet:
    > ¶3  
    > The standard process of building tracks for use in a browser yields tracks that do not satisfy this normalization constraint. If, for example, the $i$-th sequenced fragment accumulates a $+1$ at every base pair that it intersects, then the $i$-th fragment is over-counted $L_{i}$ times, with $L_{i}$ the length of the fragment in base pairs.
    > 
    > ¶4  
    > Accumulating $\frac{+1}{L_{i}}$ at each intersected base pair, instead of +1, resolves the issue of overcounting entirely.
    > 
    > A track built this way is a proper histogram and is normalized by the number of observations that went into the histogram, $\hat{R}$ for an IP and $\hat{R}_{in}$ for input, and is suitable for genome browsers.
    > 
    > In this scheme, each base pair in a fragment is equally weighted, just like when $+1$ is accumulated.
    > 
    > However, different fragments are not equally weighted unless they have the same length.
    > 
    > In particular, longer fragments will effectively contribute with lower weight because there is a greater uncertainty in 'where' the important binding event was when that fragment was captured.
+ I want to create a script, or add an argument to the current script, that enables to generate coverage tracks as described in ¶3: *"If, for example, the $i$-th sequenced fragment accumulates a $+1$ at every base pair that it intersects, then the $i$-th fragment is over-counted $L_{i}$ times, with $L_{i}$ the length of the fragment in base pairs."*
+ I believe this is how coverage is heretofore typically generated, e.g., by `deepTools`. Is that correct? Coverage is calculated and then scaled with various calculations such as FPKM, TPM, etc.

To assist you, here's the current code I am working with:

Certainly! To accommodate the additional requirement of generating a coverage track where each fragment contributes a +1 to every base it intersects (a common approach used by many genomic tools like `deepTools`), you can adjust the existing script or introduce an option to toggle between the two types of coverage calculations.

Let's modify your script to include an argument that allows the user to choose between "normalized coverage" (where each base in a fragment contributes equally) and "traditional coverage" (where each fragment contributes +1 to each base it covers). This will make your script more versatile and useful for different types of genomic analysis.

### On the differences between `calculate_coverage.py` and `bamCoverage`
<details>
<summary><i>Me</i></summary>
<br />

I called my calculation-of-coverage Python script, `calculate_coverage.py`, to generate a BEDGRAPH file with "traditional" coverage values (that is, I did not use the `--normalize` switch):
```bash
f_in="IP_G1_Hho1_6336.I.bed"
f_ou="${f_in/.bed/.tc.bedgraph}"
b_sz=30
thrd=4

python calculate_coverage.py \
    -i "${f_in}" \
    -o "${f_ou}" \
    -b "${b_sz}" \
    -t "${thrd}"
```

I expected that this should be the same as calling deepTools `bamCoverage` with `--normalizeUsing "None"`, e.g.,
```bash
bam="IP_G1_Hho1_6336.sort-coord.bam"
format="bedgraph"
b_sz=30
chr="I"
thrd=4
norm="None"
min_MAPQ=1

bamCoverage \
    --bam "${bam}" \
    --outFileName "${bam/.bam/.${chr}.bamCoverage-tc.bedgraph}" \
    --outFileFormat "bedgraph" \
    --binSize "${b_sz}" \
    --region "${chr}" \
    --numberOfProcessors "${thrd}" \
    --normalizeUsing "${norm}" \
    --minMappingQuality "${min_MAPQ}"
```

When I checked the resulting two BEDGRAPH files, I learned that their contents differ:
+ Contents of `IP_G1_Hho1_6336.I.tc.bedgraph` from the call to `calculate_coverage.py`:
```txt

...
```
+ Contents of `IP_G1_Hho1_6336.I.bamCoverage-tc.bedgraph` from the call to `bamCoverage`:
```txt
I   30  60  133
I   60  90  150
I   90  120 151
I   120 150 163

I   210 240 91
I   240 270 97
I   270 300 113
...
```

These values are quite different. In reading the documentation for `bamCoverage`, it appears that `--normalizeUsing "None"` is in fact performing a normalization. Here's the pertinent documentation:
> --normalizeUsing
> Possible choices: RPKM, CPM, BPM, RPGC, None
> 
> Use one of the entered methods to normalize the number of reads per bin. By default, no normalization is performed. RPKM = Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads; CPM = Counts Per Million mapped reads, same as CPM in RNA-seq; BPM = Bins Per Million mapped reads, same as TPM in RNA-seq; RPGC = reads per genomic content (1x normalization); Mapped reads are considered after blacklist filtering (if applied). RPKM (per bin) = number of reads per bin / (number of mapped reads (in millions) * bin length (kb)). CPM (per bin) = number of reads per bin / number of mapped reads (in millions). BPM (per bin) = number of reads per bin / sum of all reads per bin (in millions). RPGC (per bin) = number of reads per bin / scaling factor for 1x average coverage. None = the default and equivalent to not setting this option at all. This scaling factor, in turn, is determined from the sequencing depth: (total number of mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome size. The scaling factor used is the inverse of the sequencing depth computed for the sample to match the 1x coverage. This option requires –effectiveGenomeSize. Each read is considered independently, if you want to only count one mate from a pair in paired-end data, then use the –samFlagInclude/–samFlagExclude options. (Default: None)

Here's what I believe to be the relevant text describing this: *"None = the default and equivalent to not setting this option at all. This scaling factor, in turn, is determined from the sequencing depth: `(total number of mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome size`. The scaling factor used is the inverse of the sequencing depth computed for the sample to match the 1x coverage. This option requires `--effectiveGenomeSize`."*

So, am I correct? Is `--normalizeUsing "None"` doing the above-described normalization? In that case, what value is it using for `--effectiveGenomeSize`? Because I did not set a size and there is no default listed in the documentation so far as I can tell.

Indeed, your analysis is insightful and reveals a critical point about how `bamCoverage` from the deepTools suite interprets the `--normalizeUsing "None"` option. Based on the description you provided from the deepTools documentation, it appears that even when `--normalizeUsing "None"` is specified, there might still be an implicit normalization happening based on the total number of mapped reads, their fragment length, and the effective genome size.

Here are key points to consider:
1. **Normalization Behavior with `None`:** When `--normalizeUsing "None"` is set, it should ideally mean that no normalization is performed, and raw read counts should be reflected in the output. However, as you've found, the documentation hints that a scaling factor might still be in play implicitly unless explicitly controlled by other flags such as `--effectiveGenomeSize`.
2. **Missing `--effectiveGenomeSize`:** If you did not specify the `--effectiveGenomeSize`, deepTools might be using a default value based on common model organisms or it may be calculating a scaling factor based on the sequence data provided. This could explain the discrepancies you're seeing. To clarify this, it would be best to consult the deepTools documentation or source code, or run a test by explicitly setting an effective genome size to see if the output changes.
3. **Comparing to Python Script:** Your Python script's approach is direct and calculates coverage based on the entries in the BED file without any additional scaling for genome size or mapped reads. This approach is more transparent but different from how `bamCoverage` may be handling the data under the hood.
4. **DeepTools Scaling Factor:** To align with what `bamCoverage` might be doing, you could modify your Python script to include a similar normalization based on the total number of mapped reads, their lengths, and an estimated or provided effective genome size. This would make the outputs more comparable.
5. **Determining the Effective Genome Size:** If deepTools does not provide a default and you did not set one, it's possible that it uses a heuristic based on the input data or a typical genome size for known model organisms. Running `bamCoverage` with the verbose or debug option, if available, might provide more insights into what internal calculations it is performing.

To investigate further, consider:
+ Using `bamCoverage` with an explicitly set `--effectiveGenomeSize` to observe the changes.
+ Contacting the deepTools support or community for clarification on the default behavior when `--normalizeUsing "None"` is set but no genome size is provided.

If you are looking to perform coverage calculations that you can directly control and understand, maintaining your Python script with explicit parameters and perhaps adding optional normalization would be a practical approach. If precise alignment with `bamCoverage` output is crucial, understanding and replicating the exact normalization strategy it uses will be necessary.

#### Drafting a Python script to calculate `(total number of mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome size`
<details>
<summary><i>Me</i></summary>
<br />

Let's try reproducing what `bamCoverage` seemed to do, which was evaluate the following expression: `(total number of mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome size`. Please help me draft a Python script that makes use of `argparse`, `sys`, `pysam`, etc. to calculate the above expression. The script should have required arguments for a BAM infile and BEDGRAPH outfile. It should also have a required argument for effective genome size. The BAM infile should already be coordinate-sorted and indexed. The script should intelligently evaluate the "total number of mapped reads" and the "fragment length" (I'm guessing the average fragment length but am open to your thoughts on how to interpret this). Feel free to implement parallelization if and where possible, e.g., with from `concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor`.

To create a Python script that calculates coverage in a manner similar to how bamCoverage might operate under the hood, we'll follow these steps:
1. Parse the BAM file to read fragment data, ensuring it's coordinate-sorted and indexed.
2. Compute the total number of mapped reads and average fragment length.
3. Divide by the effective genome size to normalize the read coverage.
3. Write the resulting coverage values to a BEDGRAPH file.

I'll include options for parallel processing to handle large BAM files more efficiently. Let's get started on this Python script:

**Script Explanation:**
- **Processing the BAM File:** The script reads through the BAM file, counting the total number of reads and accumulating fragment lengths for properly paired reads. This calculation assumes that the average fragment length and the total number of mapped reads are adequate proxies for the coverage density.
- **Normalization Calculation:** The coverage normalization factor is computed using the total number of reads multiplied by the average fragment length and then divided by the provided effective genome size.
- **Output:** The calculated scaling factor is written to a BEDGRAPH file, which is useful for understanding the scaling applied to your dataset but is not a traditional BEDGRAPH track of genomic coverage.

**Parallelization:**
The script currently doesn't employ parallel processing due to the sequential nature of reading from the BAM file for global metrics like total reads and average fragment length. However, you could potentially parallelize the reading of multiple BAM files or different regions if splitting the work is feasible.

This approach should align your coverage normalization more closely with the methodology you deduced from `bamCoverage`.

Let's modify the Python script to not only calculate the scaling factor but also to apply this factor to compute normalized and binned coverage values, which will then be written to a BEDGRAPH file. This will integrate both the scaling calculation and the output into a comprehensive workflow.

**Explanation:**
+ **Coverage Calculation:** The script now iterates over each read in the BAM file, calculating the contribution of each read to the coverage. This is accumulated directly into bins.
+ **Normalization:** After collecting the coverage, it's normalized using the scaling factor derived from the total number of reads, average fragment length, and the effective genome size.
+ **Output:** The normalized, binned coverage is written to a BEDGRAPH file, providing a ready-to-use track for genomic browsers or further analysis.

This script will give you a BEDGRAPH file that matches the detailed requirements of normalized genomic coverage based on the given effective genome size.

The function `calculate_coverage` is designed to compute the normalized and binned genomic coverage from a BAM file using several parameters. Here's a breakdown of its operation and the purpose of each part:

1. Function Setup
- Inputs:
    + `bam_file_path`: Path to the input BAM file.
    + `effective_genome_size`: A predefined number representing the total length of the genome adjusted for regions that are mappable.
    + `bin_size`: The size of the genomic intervals (bins) in base pairs over which the coverage is averaged.
- Initializations:
    + `bamfile`: A `pysam.AlignmentFile` object opened in read-only (`"rb"`) mode.
    + `coverage`: A dictionary (using `defaultdict(float)`) to hold the coverage data, initialized to zero for each genomic bin.
    + `total_reads`: A counter to tally the total number of reads that pass filters (mapped, not secondary, not supplementary).
    + `total_fragment_length`: Accumulates the total length of all fragments considered in the analysis.
    + `num_fragments`: Counts the number of fragments (paired-end reads) that are properly paired and counted.
2. Read Processing Loop
- Iteration Over Reads:
    + The function iterates over each read in the BAM file using `bamfile.fetch()`.
    + Filters:
        - Only reads that are mapped (`not read.is_unmapped`), not secondary (`not read.is_secondary`), and not supplementary (`not read.is_supplementary`) are considered.
    + Fragment Handling:
        - If a read is part of a proper pair (`read.is_proper_pair`) and is the first read in the pair (`read.is_read1`), it processes the fragment defined by the paired reads.
        - Fragment Length:
            + The fragment length is determined by `read.template_length` (the distance between the start of the first read and the end of the last read in a pair).
            + Only positive lengths are considered (indicating proper orientation and pairing).
            + The total length of these fragments is accumulated in `total_fragment_length`, and `num_fragments` is incremented.
        - Coverage Calculation:
            + The coverage increment for each base pair covered by the fragment is calculated as `1.0 / fragment_length`, ensuring that each fragment contributes equally regardless of its length.
            + Coverage increments are added to the appropriate bins. The start of the bin is calculated by flooring the position to the nearest multiple of `bin_size`.
3. Post-Loop Calculations
- Average Fragment Length:
    + After processing all reads, the average fragment length is calculated by dividing the `total_fragment_length` by the number of counted fragments (`num_fragments`).
- Scaling Factor:
    + The scaling factor is computed as `(total_reads * average_fragment_length) / effective_genome_size`. This factor aims to normalize the coverage to a per-genome basis, factoring in the depth and the size of the genome.
4. Normalization and Output
- Coverage Normalization:
    + The raw coverage values stored in coverage are then divided by the scaling factor to normalize them according to the calculated genome coverage.
- Return:
    + The function returns the coverage dictionary containing the normalized, binned genomic coverage.

This method ensures that the coverage is represented in a way that accounts for both the depth of sequencing and the genomic context, making it suitable for comparison across different samples or genomic regions.

#### Reassessment of the coverage calculation

This script is still trying to normalize the coverage by evaluating the following expression, right?

`(total number of mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome size`
</details>
<br />

<details>
<summary><i>GPT4</i></summary>
<br />

Yes, that's correct. The script calculates the normalized coverage by evaluating the expression `(total number of mapped reads × average fragment length) / effective genome size`. This expression effectively scales the raw coverage values by adjusting for the total amount of sequencing data (in terms of read count and their lengths) relative to the size of the genome that is being studied. This scaling factor normalizes the read coverage so that it represents a standardized measure of sequencing depth across different samples or conditions, assuming the effective genome size reflects the mappable portion of the genome.

The key points in the formula are:
1. **Total number of mapped reads:** Sum of all reads that are properly mapped, not secondary, and not supplementary. This gives a measure of the sequencing effort focused on mappable genome regions.
2. **Average fragment length:** Calculated as the average length of all properly paired fragments (using read1 from each pair to avoid double-counting). This reflects the average distance between paired reads that span genomic features.
3. **Effective genome size:** An input parameter representing the total mappable length of the genome. This adjusts the coverage to a per-genome basis, accounting for variations in genome size or mappability across different organisms or experimental conditions.

Together, these components ensure that the coverage values are scaled appropriately to represent an "even" view of sequencing depth, standardized to a "per-genome" level, which is critical for comparative genomic analyses and for various genomic visualization tools.

#### On the use of `TLEN` for determining fragment length
<details>
<summary><i>Me</i></summary>
<br />

> + The fragment length is determined by `read.template_length` (the distance between the start of the first read and the end of the last read in a pair).

This is done by evaluating field 10 (`TLEN`) in the BAM file?
</details>
<br />

<details>
<summary><i>GPT4</i></summary>
<br />

Yes, that's correct! In a BAM file, the `template_length` (often found in the `TLEN` field) refers to the observed length of the DNA fragment that produced the paired-end reads. Here's how it works:
- **TLEN Field:** This field is the 9th field in the SAM/BAM format (not the 10th, as might have been suggested). It reports the length of the template (fragment) that the reads come from. It's calculated as the difference between the position of the first aligned base of the first read and the position of the last aligned base of the last read in the pair, including the bases of the reads themselves.
- **Interpretation:**
    + If `TLEN` is positive, the second read in the pair is aligned downstream (toward the end of the chromosome) relative to the first read.
    + If `TLEN` is negative, the second read in the pair is aligned upstream (toward the start of the chromosome) relative to the first read.
    + The absolute value of `TLEN` gives the span of the DNA fragment.

**Usage in Coverage Calculation:**
When calculating coverage from paired-end data:
- **Proper Pairs:** Only reads that are properly paired (`read.is_proper_pair`) should be used because these reads reliably indicate the presence of the intended DNA fragment.
- **Positive Template Length:** The script often checks that `read.template_length` is positive to ensure the fragment is oriented in the standard way and the reads are not misaligned or erroneous.
- **Fragment Contribution:** Each position within this fragment's span contributes to the coverage. By dividing the contribution across the fragment's length (`1.0 / template_length`), each base pair covered by the fragment contributes equally to the overall coverage map.

This method ensures that each sequenced fragment, regardless of its length, contributes equally to the final coverage, helping avoid bias toward longer fragments in the sequencing data.

<details>
<summary><i>Me</i></summary>
<br />

> - Coverage Calculation:

I don't understand what `1.0 / fragment_length` is doing and why it is needed. Can you explain this to me some more?
</details>
<br />

<details>
<summary><i>GPT4</i></summary>
<br />

Certainly! The term `1.0 / fragment_length` is used to ensure that each base pair within a fragment contributes equally to the total coverage computation, and it's crucial for producing a normalized coverage track.

**What does `1.0 / fragment_length` do?**
This calculation determines the contribution of each base pair in a fragment to the overall coverage. Let's break it down:
Fragment Length: This is the total number of base pairs spanned by a fragment, calculated from the start of the first read to the end of the second read in a properly paired fragment.
Contribution Per Base Pair: By using 1.0 / fragment_length, we assign an equal contribution to every base pair within that fragment. The idea is that if a fragment spans 100 base pairs, each base pair contributes 1/100 to the coverage at that position.

**Why is it needed?**
- **Equal Weighting Within a Fragment:** Without this calculation, if you simply added a count of 1 to each base pair that a fragment covers, fragments of different lengths would contribute disproportionately to the coverage. Longer fragments would dominate the coverage signal simply because they cover more base pairs.
- **Normalization of Fragment Contribution:** With `1.0 / fragment_length`, every fragment, regardless of its length, has an equal total contribution to the coverage. This means that each fragment, whether it is 100 bp or 1000 bp long, contributes equally to the total coverage signal. This approach ensures that the coverage metric reflects the number of overlapping fragments rather than the length of those fragments.

**Practical Example**
Suppose you have two fragments:
- Fragment A is 100 bp long.
- Fragment B is 200 bp long.

If both fragments cover a particular base pair:
- Without normalization (`1.0 / fragment_length`), if each base pair in each fragment adds 1 to the coverage, the base pairs in Fragment B would collectively add more to the coverage simply because there are more of them.
- With normalization (`1.0 / fragment_length`), each base pair in Fragment A adds 1/100 to the coverage, and each base pair in Fragment B adds 1/200. The total contribution of each fragment to any base pair it covers is exactly 1, making the coverage dependent only on the number of overlapping fragments, not their sizes.

**Summary**
The use of `1.0 / fragment_length` is a method to ensure that the coverage data is unbiased by fragment length and reflects only the density and distribution of fragments across the genome. This method is crucial for applications like ChIP-seq or RNA-seq, where the evenness of coverage across various genomic features is important for downstream analyses.

#### Is `1.0 / fragment_length` included in the deepTools `bamCoverage` calculation of coverage?
<details>
<summary><i>Me</i></summary>
<br />

Is the use `1.0 / fragment_length` (or the like) standard in how deepTools `bamCoverage` calculates coverage?
</details>
<br />

<details>
<summary><i>GPT4</i></summary>
<br />

No, the use of `1.0 / fragment_length` for calculating coverage is not standard in deepTools `bamCoverage` under typical usage scenarios. deepTools `bamCoverage` typically accumulates coverage by incrementing the count for each base covered by a read by 1.0 (or another user-defined weight). This means that for each base pair a read or fragment covers, it adds a count of 1.0 to that position.

**How deepTools Handles Coverage Calculation:**
- **Coverage Calculation:** deepTools `bamCoverage` usually increments the coverage at each position covered by a read by 1. This is similar to the traditional pile-up where each overlapping read contributes equally to the final coverage value at each position.
- **Normalization Options:** deepTools offers normalization options like RPKM, CPM, BPM, and RPGC. These options do not change how coverage is initially calculated but affect how these raw coverage values are scaled or normalized to make them comparable across different samples or to account for sequencing depth and genome size.

The formula `1.0 / fragment_length` that you mentioned would distribute a single count of 1.0 equally among all bases that a fragment covers, thus ensuring that the total contribution of each fragment to the coverage is 1.0 regardless of its length. This method is particularly useful if you want to avoid over-representing long fragments, which naturally cover more base pairs and could bias the coverage profile.

**In Contrast with deepTools:**
- deepTools accumulates raw counts more traditionally (each base in a read contributes 1 count to its position), and normalization methods are applied afterwards to scale these counts based on sequencing depth, effective genome size, or other factors.
- The method `1.0 / fragment_length` normalizes the contribution of each fragment at the moment of coverage calculation, which is fundamentally different from how normalization is typically handled in deepTools.

In conclusion, if you need every fragment to contribute equally to the coverage regardless of its length, using `1.0 / fragment_length` is an approach that you could consider, but it's not standard in tools like deepTools under their default configuration. For deepTools, you might need to explore its various normalization options to see if one fits this model or use a custom script for such calculations.

Understood! If the goal is to closely replicate what `bamCoverage --normalizeUsing "None"` does, the approach would typically be more straightforward: incrementing the coverage count by 1 for each base covered by a read, without any division by fragment length. This is the traditional way to calculate coverage, which directly reflects the read pileup at each genomic position.

When `bamCoverage` is run with the `--normalizeUsing "None"` option, it generally means no normalization post hoc. However, as per the documentation, even with "None", there might be an underlying default normalization applied if certain parameters are set or implied. To accurately emulate `bamCoverage --normalizeUsing "None"` using your Python script, you would:
1. **Calculate raw coverage:** Increment the coverage for each base a read covers by 1, without dividing by the fragment length. This mirrors the typical read pileup method.
2. **Bin the results:** Aggregate these counts into bins as specified by `bin_size`.

Here's how you could adjust the script to compute coverage as described, more in line with the standard behavior of `bamCoverage --normalizeUsing "None"`:

Is the handling of average fragment length in the code you posted for the updated `calculate_coverage`? It looks like it is not. Why did you remove it?

How can we evaluate the expression `(total number of mapped reads * fragment length) / effective genome size` without a value for average fragment length?

I believe we want something like this (but please correct and update the code as necessary):

You're right in pointing out the omission of the average fragment length calculation in my previous response. Indeed, if the intention is to evaluate the expression `(total number of mapped reads × fragment length)/effective genome size`, then we certainly need to compute the average fragment length, especially for accurate normalization.

Your proposed code snippet reintroduces the average fragment length calculation, which is necessary for computing the scaling factor as per the specified formula. Here's a refined version of your code with some additional comments to clarify each step:

def calculate_coverage(bam_file_path, effective_genome_size, bin_size):
    """

    bamfile = pysam.AlignmentFile(bam_file_path, "rb")
    coverage = defaultdict(float)
    total_reads = 0
    total_fragment_length = 0
    num_fragments = 0

    # Read through the BAM file and calculate coverage
    for read in bamfile.fetch():
        if not read.is_unmapped and not read.is_secondary and not read.is_supplementary:

                fragment_length = read.template_length
                if fragment_length > 0:
                    total_fragment_length += fragment_length
                    num_fragments += 1
                    start = read.reference_start
                    end = read.reference_end
                    chrom = bamfile.get_reference_name(read.reference_id)
                    
                    # Increment coverage by 1 for each base covered by the read
                    for pos in range(start, end):
                        bin_start = (pos // bin_size) * bin_size
                        coverage[(chrom, bin_start)] += 1

    # Calculate average fragment length
    average_fragment_length = total_fragment_length / num_fragments if num_fragments else 0

    # Calculate the scaling factor
    scaling_factor = (total_reads * average_fragment_length) / effective_genome_size

    # Normalize the coverage by the scaling factor
    for key in coverage:
        coverage[key] /= scaling_factor

    return coverage
```
</details>
<br />

**Key Points**
- **Coverage Calculation:** Increments by 1 for each base pair covered by the fragment. This aligns with traditional coverage calculations and avoids over-counting, assuming each base pair contributes equally to the final coverage count.
- **Average Fragment Length:** The calculation is re-established to ensure that the scaling factor is correctly derived from the product of the total number of mapped reads and the average fragment length divided by the effective genome size.
- **Normalization:** The coverage is normalized by the calculated scaling factor to adjust for sequencing depth and average fragment length relative to the effective genome size.

This script should now correctly calculate the normalized coverage as per your requirements and should be consistent with genomic coverage calculations typical of other genomic analysis tools when not applying specific normalization strategies beyond the basic scaling for sequencing depth and genome size.

Yes, your script is almost complete and properly structured to calculate and output the normalized and binned coverage. However, there are a few small adjustments and clarifications needed to ensure that it runs smoothly:
1. **BAM File Indexing Check:** The script currently tries to index the BAM file every time it runs, which isn't necessary if the BAM file is already indexed. We should change this to a check that confirms the existence of the index rather than trying to index it again.
2. **Error Handling:** Adding more specific error messages might help in debugging or running the script smoothly.
3. **Documentation and Code Readability:** Adding a few more comments to explain key parts could be beneficial, especially in a shared or collaborative environment.

Here is the adjusted version of your script:

**Note:** The indexing check with `pysam.index()` as used above is incorrect; `pysam.index()` is meant to index a BAM file, not check its presence. Instead, you should manually check for the existence of the .bai file or handle this via try-except when opening the file with `pysam.AlignmentFile`.

This script is now more robust and should perform the intended calculations correctly. It’s essential to ensure that the BAM file is properly sorted and indexed before running this script, as these are prerequisites for efficient access and data retrieval necessary for coverage calculation.

**Key Changes:**
1. **Command-line Argument for MAPQ:** Added a new argument `--min_mapq` to specify the minimum MAPQ score required for a read to be considered in the coverage calculation. It defaults to 1.
2. **Filtering Reads by MAPQ:** Modified the loop that processes reads to include a check for the mapping quality: `read.mapping_quality >= min_mapq`.
3. **Documentation:** Updated function and script documentation to reflect the new functionality.

This script should now only consider reads that meet the specified MAPQ threshold, allowing more fine-grained control over which reads contribute to the calculated coverage.

#### Extending the script to work with particular regions of the genome
<details>

<br />

Let's also extend the script to allow the user to work with a region of the BAM file, rather than the entire contents of the BAM file. The argument can `-r`, `--region`, and the user can supply values such as "all" (default), "I" (for just chromosome I), or "I:1-100" (to, say, work with the region 1–100 bp on chromosome I). Can we do this?

<summary><i>GPT4</i></summary>
<br />

To extend the script to handle specific genomic regions as input, you can modify it to accept a `--region` argument. This will allow users to specify a particular region of interest directly from the command line. The Pysam library conveniently supports fetching reads from specified regions, which we can leverage in this case.

Here's how to modify the script to include the `--region` parameter:

**Key Changes:**
1. **Region Argument:** Added the `--region` command-line argument to specify a genomic region. It defaults to `"all"`, which means the entire genome.
2. **Fetching Reads:** Modified the calculate_coverage function to fetch reads from the specified region using the `bamfile.fetch(region=fetch_region)` method. The region string is passed directly to this method, which accepts inputs like `"chr1"`, `"chr1:1000-5000"`, etc.
3. **Flexibility:** Users can specify regions in a flexible format, which makes the script versatile for various types of genomic analyses.

This script now allows users to target specific regions in the genome for coverage calculation, thereby providing more focused and potentially faster analysis for large BAM files.

The error message indicates that the script thinks your BAM file isn't indexed, even though the index file `.bai` clearly exists. This might be happening because the script incorrectly checks for the index. The `pysam.index()` function you're attempting to use is actually meant to create an index, not to check if one exists.

To fix this, you should modify the script to check for the existence of the index file directly rather than trying to index the file again. You can use `pysam`'s `IndexedReads` object to see if the file can be accessed with an index without actually performing the indexing.

Here’s how you can modify the check for the BAM file being indexed:

<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
import pysam
import sys

def is_bam_indexed(bam_file_path):
    """
    Check if the BAM file is indexed by trying to fetch from it.
    This function assumes the BAM file is coordinate-sorted.
    """
    try:
        bamfile = pysam.AlignmentFile(bam_file_path, "rb")
        try:
            bamfile.fetch()
            return True
        except ValueError:
            return False
    finally:
        bamfile.close()

def main():
    # Your existing main function code...
    parser.add_argument('-i', '--input_bam', required=True, help="Input BAM file path (coordinate-sorted and indexed).")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Check if BAM file is indexed
    if not is_bam_indexed(args.input_bam):
        print("Error: BAM file must be indexed. Please create an index (e.g., using `samtools index`).")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Remaining code...
```
</details>
<br />

This modification introduces a function, `is_bam_indexed`, which attempts to open the BAM file and perform a fetch operation. If the fetch operation raises a `ValueError`, it implies that the BAM file is not indexed. This approach avoids the unnecessary indexing operation and properly checks the index availability by actually trying to use it.

By using `try...except` around `bamfile.fetch()`, we ensure that any error related to fetching without an index is caught, and we return `False` to indicate the index is missing. This should resolve the issue with the script incorrectly reporting that your BAM files aren't indexed.

But that leads to the question of how coverage is actually calculated by deepTools. I believe the answer may be in the deepTools script [`writeBedGraph.py`](https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools/blob/master/deeptools/writeBedGraph.py). Do you mind to help me understand code that I will paste in from [`writeBedGraph.py`](https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools/blob/master/deeptools/writeBedGraph.py)?

### Can we determine how coverage is calculated from [`writeBedGraph.py`](https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools/blob/master/deeptools/writeBedGraph.py)?
**(No. GPT4's answer is wrong but useful.)**

Looking at the following code, can you explain to me how coverage is calculated? Does the code actually contain that info? If so, where is it, what is it, and how is it working?

<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
class WriteBedGraph(cr.CountReadsPerBin):

    r"""Reads bam files coverages and writes a bedgraph or bigwig file

    Extends the CountReadsPerBin object such that the coverage
    of bam files is writen to multiple bedgraph files at once.

    The bedgraph files are later merge into one and converted
    into a bigwig file if necessary.

    The constructor arguments are the same as for CountReadsPerBin. However,
    when calling the `run` method, the following parameters have
    to be passed

    Examples
    --------

    Given the following distribution of reads that cover 200 on
    a chromosome named '3R'::

          0                              100                           200
          |------------------------------------------------------------|
        A                                ===============
                                                        ===============


        B                 ===============               ===============
                                         ===============
                                                        ===============

    >>> import tempfile
    >>> test_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) + "/test/test_data/"

    >>> outFile = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile()
    >>> bam_file = test_path +  "testA.bam"

    For the example a simple scaling function is going to be used. This function
    takes the coverage found at each region and multiplies it to the scaling factor.
    In this case the scaling factor is 1.5

    >>> function_to_call = scaleCoverage
    >>> funcArgs = {'scaleFactor': 1.5}

    Restrict process to a region between positions 0 and 200 of chromosome 3R

    >>> region = '3R:0:200'

    Set up such that coverage is computed for consecutive bins of length 25 bp
    >>> bin_length = 25
    >>> step_size = 25

    >>> num_sample_sites = 0 #overruled by step_size
    >>> c = WriteBedGraph([bam_file], binLength=bin_length, region=region, stepSize=step_size)
    >>> c.run(function_to_call, funcArgs, outFile.name)
    >>> f = open(outFile.name, 'r')
    >>> f.readlines()
    ['3R\t0\t100\t0\n', '3R\t100\t200\t1.5\n']
    >>> f.close()
    >>> outFile.close()

The `WriteBedGraph` class from deepTools extends `CountReadsPerBin` and focuses on reading bam file coverages and writing to bedgraph or bigwig files. This class makes it possible to write coverage of bam files to multiple bedgraph files simultaneously, which are later merged and potentially converted into a bigwig file. Let's break down how coverage is calculated and how the script works:

**Key Elements of the Code:**
1. Class Overview:
    + Inherits from CountReadsPerBin, which presumably handles the binning of read counts.
    + Main purpose: Convert BAM file read coverages into a bedgraph or bigwig format.
2. Method - `run()`:
    + Purpose: Handles the workflow of reading BAM files, applying a function to convert coverages into values for bedgraph, and writing the output.
    + Parameters:
        - `func_to_call`: Function that transforms the list of coverages computed for each BAM file at each position into a single value.
        - `func_args`: Arguments for `func_to_call`, e.g., scaling factors.
        - `out_file_name`: Where to save the output.
        - `smoothLength`: Optional parameter for smoothing coverage over a specified length.
3. Coverage Calculation:
    + The actual computation of read coverage across the genome does not seem to be fully detailed in the provided method `run()`. This method sets up the processing, including opening BAM files and handling parameters.
    + It mentions `writeBedGraph_wrapper` and `chrom_names_and_size` which are likely crucial for actual data handling but are not detailed in the snippet.
4. Mapping and Reducing:
    + The method employs `mapReduce` (presumably a utility within deepTools) for parallel processing of data. This involves applying the `func_to_call` across different segments of the genome (or specified regions).
5. Writing Output:
    + Depending on the format specified (`bedgraph` or `bigwig`), it manages the output writing. For `bedgraph`, it aggregates results from temporary files written by worker functions.
6. Worker Function - `writeBedGraph_worker()`:
    + This function seems to be the workhorse for computing the actual coverage values for each tile or bin across the genome.
    + Process:
        - Checks the given region for validity (start should not be greater than end).
        - Computes coverage using `self.count_reads_in_region()`.
        - Depending on the `smoothLength`, it might average the coverage over a larger area to smooth the results.
        - Uses `func_to_call` to convert raw coverage into the desired metric, adjusting for user-defined factors (`func_args`).
        - Writes results to a temporary file, handling continuous regions with the same value by extending the end position until a change is detected.

**Summary:**

The provided code sets up a comprehensive framework for processing BAM files to produce coverage metrics in a flexible, customizable manner through user-defined functions and smoothing. The actual calculation of coverage per base (or per bin) and its normalization (if any) is handled by `func_to_call`, which is not defined in this snippet but is central to transforming raw read counts into the final values written to the output files. The normalization and actual coverage calculations happen in the context of this function, likely relying on the read counts and other genomic metrics passed as arguments.

If you need to understand or modify how the coverage is calculated (for example, to implement a specific normalization method), you would need to look into how `func_to_call` is implemented or specify a new function that meets your criteria for coverage calculation.

Thanks. `WriteBedGraph` is not exactly where coverage is calculated, as you suggested. Let's look at the code associated with the class [`CountReadsPerBin`](https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools/blob/master/deeptools/countReadsPerBin.py).

Below is the code for the class. Looking at the following code, can you explain to me how coverage is calculated? Does the code actually contain that info? If so, where is it, what is it, and how is it working?

```python
class CountReadsPerBin(object):

    r"""Collects coverage over multiple bam files using multiprocessing

    This function collects read counts (coverage) from several bam files and returns
    an numpy array with the results. This class uses multiprocessing to compute the coverage.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bamFilesList : list
        List containing the names of indexed bam files. E.g. ['file1.bam', 'file2.bam']

    binLength : int
        Length of the window/bin. This value is overruled by ``bedFile`` if present.

    numberOfSamples : int
        Total number of samples. The genome is divided into ``numberOfSamples``, each
        with a window/bin length equal to ``binLength``. This value is overruled
        by ``stepSize`` in case such value is present and by ``bedFile`` in which
        case the number of samples and bins are defined in the bed file

    numberOfProcessors : int
        Number of processors to use. Default is 4

    verbose : bool
        Output messages. Default: False

    region : str
        Region to limit the computation in the form chrom:start:end.

    bedFile : list of file_handles.
        Each file handle corresponds to a bed file containing the regions for which to compute the coverage. This option
        overrules ``binLength``, ``numberOfSamples`` and ``stepSize``.

    blackListFileName : str
        A string containing a BED file with blacklist regions.

    extendReads : bool, int

        Whether coverage should be computed for the extended read length (i.e. the region covered
        by the two mates or the regions expected to be covered by single-reads).
        If the value is 'int', then then this is interpreted as the fragment length to extend reads
        that are not paired. For Illumina reads, usual values are around 300.
        This value can be determined using the peak caller MACS2 or can be
        approximated by the fragment lengths computed when preparing the library for sequencing. If the value
        is of the variable is true and not value is given, the fragment size is sampled from the library but
        only if the library is paired-end. Default: False


    minMappingQuality : int
        Reads of a mapping quality less than the give value are not considered. Default: None

    ignoreDuplicates : bool
        Whether read duplicates (same start, end position. If paired-end, same start-end for mates) are
        to be excluded. Default: false

    chrToSkip: list
        List with names of chromosomes that do not want to be included in the coverage computation.
        This is useful to remove unwanted chromosomes (e.g. 'random' or 'Het').

    stepSize : int
        the positions for which the coverage is computed are defined as follows:
        ``range(start, end, stepSize)``. Thus, a stepSize of 1, will compute
        the coverage at each base pair. If the stepSize is equal to the
        binLength then the coverage is computed for consecutive bins. If seepSize is
        smaller than the binLength, then teh bins will overlap.

    center_read : bool
        Determines if reads should be centered with respect to the fragment length.

    samFlag_include : int
        Extracts only those reads having the SAM flag. For example, to get only
        reads that are the first mates a samFlag of 64 could be used. Similarly, the
        samFlag_include can be used to select only reads mapping on the reverse strand
        or to get only properly paired reads.

    samFlag_exclude : int
        Removes reads that match the SAM flag. For example to get all reads
        that map to the forward strand a samFlag_exlude 16 should be used. Which
        translates into exclude all reads that map to the reverse strand.

    zerosToNans : bool
        If true, zero values encountered are transformed to Nans. Default false.

    skipZeroOverZero : bool
        If true, skip bins where all input BAM files have no coverage (only applicable to bamCompare).

    minFragmentLength : int
        If greater than 0, fragments below this size are excluded.

    maxFragmentLength : int
        If greater than 0, fragments above this size are excluded.

    out_file_for_raw_data : str
        File name to save the raw counts computed

    statsList : list
        For each BAM file in bamFilesList, the associated per-chromosome statistics returned by openBam

    mappedList : list
        For each BAM file in bamFilesList, the number of mapped reads in the file.

    bed_and_bin : boolean
        If true AND a bedFile is given, compute coverage of each bin of the given size in each region of bedFile

    genomeChunkSize : int
        If not None, the length of the genome used for multiprocessing.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy array

        Each row correspond to each bin/bed region and each column correspond to each of
        the bamFiles.


    Examples
    --------

    The test data contains reads for 200 bp.

    >>> test = Tester()

    The transpose function is used to get a nicer looking output.
    The first line corresponds to the number of reads per bin in bam file 1

The class `CountReadsPerBin` from deepTools is designed to process BAM files and compute coverage across specified regions, handling various options for read extension, binning, and filtering. It uses parallel processing to handle large datasets efficiently. Here’s a breakdown of how coverage is calculated and what the essential parts of the class do:

**Key Components:**
1. Initialization and Configuration:
    + `__init__()` sets up the class with parameters like BAM files list, bin length, region of interest, whether to extend reads, and various filtering options such as minimum mapping quality and duplicate read exclusion. It also handles the configuration for read extension and sets default fragment lengths based on the input data or specified parameters.
2. Coverage Calculation:
    + The actual computation of read coverage seems to be distributed across several methods within the class, with `count_reads_in_region()` being a critical method where read counts are accumulated for specified regions.

**Detailed Breakdown of `count_reads_in_region()`:**
This method is central to computing the coverage from BAM files. Here's what happens step-by-step:
- Setup and BAM File Handling:
    + Opens BAM file handles for all specified files and prepares for read fetching.
    + Applies blacklisting of regions if specified, avoiding those areas in coverage calculations.
- Coverage Calculation Logic:
    + Iterates through specified genomic regions (or tiles, defined by the bin length and step size).
    + For each region, fetches reads from the BAM files that overlap with the region, taking into account any extensions or restrictions (like fragment length).
    + For each read, it computes the overlap with the genomic tiles. This involves determining the start and end of the coverage based on whether the read is extended, paired, or single-end.
    + The coverage is incremented for each base pair that a read covers within the specified tiles.
    + Optionally, reads can be extended to a predefined fragment length, and this extension can be centered around the read if specified.
- Output:
    + The method returns a numpy array with the coverage counts for each bin across each BAM file, structured to allow subsequent processing or output.

**Extensions and Filtering:**
- Read Extension:
    + If `extendReads` is set, reads are extended to either a specified length or sampled from the data. This helps in scenarios like ChIP-seq where the actual binding site might extend beyond the sequenced read.
    + Extension can be centered on the read to distribute the assumed coverage more realistically around the sequenced fragment.
- Filtering:
    + Reads are filtered based on mapping quality, duplicate status, specified SAM flags, and blacklisted regions.
    + Fragment length filters exclude reads that are too short or too long, which can help in excluding artifacts or non-representative data.

**Parallel Processing:**
- While not shown directly in the provided snippet, the class is designed to work with `mapReduce`, which suggests that coverage computation for different regions or tiles can be parallelized across multiple processors, enhancing performance especially for large datasets.

**Integration with Other Components:**
- The class is likely used in conjunction with other deepTools components to format the output (e.g., converting coverage counts to bedGraph or bigWig formats), apply normalizations, or integrate with visualizations and further analyses.

In summary, `CountReadsPerBin` efficiently handles the computation of read coverage from BAM files, with robust support for various genomic data processing scenarios including handling of paired-end data, read extensions, and comprehensive filtering options. The actual coverage calculation is performed by iterating over reads, adjusting their positions based on the configured options, and incrementing coverage counters accordingly. This modular and configurable approach allows it to be a versatile tool in genomic analyses pipelines.

Certainly! Let's dissect the `__init__` method of the `CountReadsPerBin` class line-by-line to understand how it initializes an instance and sets up various configurations based on the provided arguments.

**Constructor Definition**
<details>
<summary><i>Python</i></summary>

```python
def __init__(self, bamFilesList, binLength=50, numberOfSamples=None, numberOfProcessors=1,
             verbose=False, region=None, bedFile=None, extendReads=False,
             genomeChunkSize=None, blackListFileName=None, minMappingQuality=None,
             ignoreDuplicates=False, chrsToSkip=[], stepSize=None, center_read=False,
             samFlag_include=None, samFlag_exclude=None, zerosToNans=False,
             skipZeroOverZero=False, smoothLength=0, minFragmentLength=0,
             maxFragmentLength=0, out_file_for_raw_data=None, bed_and_bin=False,
             statsList=[], mappedList=[]):
```
</details>
<br />

- Purpose: Initializes an instance of the `CountReadsPerBin` class with various parameters that control how read coverage is calculated from BAM files.
- Parameters: Includes file lists, binning details, read extension options, quality controls, and more, each of which affects how the final coverage is calculated.

**Instance Variables Initialization**

<summary><i>Python</i></summary>

```python
self.bamFilesList = bamFilesList
self.binLength = binLength
self.numberOfSamples = numberOfSamples
self.blackListFileName = blackListFileName

self.mappedList = mappedList
self.skipZeroOverZero = skipZeroOverZero
self.bed_and_bin = bed_and_bin
self.genomeChunkSize = genomeChunkSize
```
</details>
<br />

- These lines are straightforward assignments of parameters to instance variables. They store configuration options and data that will be used throughout the object's methods.

**Read Extension Logic**
<details>
<summary><i>Python</i></summary>

```python
if extendReads and len(bamFilesList):
    from deeptools.getFragmentAndReadSize import get_read_and_fragment_length
    frag_len_dict, read_len_dict = get_read_and_fragment_length(bamFilesList[0], return_lengths=False,
                                                                blackListFileName=blackListFileName,
                                                                numberOfProcessors=numberOfProcessors,
                                                                verbose=verbose)
    if extendReads is True:
        if frag_len_dict:
            self.defaultFragmentLength = int(frag_len_dict['median'])
        else:
            exit("*ERROR*: library is not paired-end. Please provide an extension length.")
        if verbose:
            print("Fragment length based on paired end data estimated to be {}".format(frag_len_dict['median']))

    elif extendReads < read_len_dict['median']:
        sys.stderr.write("*WARNING*: read extension is smaller than read length (read length = {}). "
                         "Reads will not be extended.\n".format(int(read_len_dict['median'])))
        self.defaultFragmentLength = 'read length'

    elif extendReads > 2000:
        exit("*ERROR*: read extension must be smaller that 2000. Value give: {} ".format(extendReads))
    else:
        self.defaultFragmentLength = int(extendReads)

else:
    self.defaultFragmentLength = 'read length'
```
</details>
<br />

- Purpose: Configures how reads are extended. If `extendReads` is true, it fetches the median fragment length from the first BAM file in the list. If `extendReads` is a specific value, it checks against the median read length or a maximum allowable extension. This setting is crucial for determining the region each read will cover in the coverage calculation.

**Additional Configuration**
<details>
<summary><i>Python</i></summary>

```python
self.numberOfProcessors = numberOfProcessors
self.verbose = verbose
self.region = region
self.bedFile = bedFile
self.minMappingQuality = minMappingQuality
self.ignoreDuplicates = ignoreDuplicates
self.chrsToSkip = chrsToSkip
self.stepSize = stepSize
self.center_read = center_read
self.samFlag_include = samFlag_include
self.samFlag_exclude = samFlag_exclude
self.minFragmentLength = minFragmentLength
self.maxFragmentLength = maxFragmentLength
self.zerosToNans = zerosToNans
self.smoothLength = smoothLength
```
</details>
<br />

- These lines continue the pattern of setting instance variables from the constructor parameters. Each variable plays a role in how the `CountReadsPerBin` object will process the BAM files to calculate coverage.

- Purpose: Ensures that necessary configurations are set (like `stepSize` or `bedFile`). Adjusts the maximum allowed fragment length based on settings and tries to populate mappedList and `statsList` with data from the BAM files if they haven't been populated yet.

This constructor method sets up an object capable of calculating read coverage across multiple BAM files using specified binning and filtering criteria. It handles various configuration options that affect how reads are counted, extended, and processed.

Do a deep, systematic breakdown for me for what's happening in the code for `count_reads_in_region`:

<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
    def count_reads_in_region(self, chrom, start, end, bed_regions_list=None):
        """Counts the reads in each bam file at each 'stepSize' position
        within the interval (start, end) for a window or bin of size binLength.

        The stepSize controls the distance between bins. For example,
        a step size of 20 and a bin size of 20 will create bins next to
        each other. If the step size is smaller than the bin size the
        bins will overlap.

        If a list of bedRegions is given, then the number of reads
        that overlaps with each region is counted.

        Parameters
        ----------
        chrom : str
            Chrom name
        start : int
            start coordinate
        end : int

        bed_regions_list: list
            List of list of tuples of the form (start, end)
            corresponding to bed regions to be processed.
            If not bed file was passed to the object constructor
            then this list is empty.

        Returns
        -------
        numpy array
            The result is a numpy array that as rows each bin
            and as columns each bam file.


        Examples
        --------
        Initialize some useful values

        >>> test = Tester()
        >>> c = CountReadsPerBin([test.bamFile1, test.bamFile2], 25, 0, stepSize=50)

The `count_reads_in_region` method in the `CountReadsPerBin` class from deepTools is a complex function designed to calculate coverage from BAM files for specified genomic regions. The function is intricately linked with various class properties and leverages several options for handling the genomic data. Let’s break down what’s happening in this method:

**Purpose:**
The function aims to count the reads within each specified genomic region (bin) across multiple BAM files, handling various parameters like step size, extension of reads, blacklisting, etc.

**Detailed Breakdown:**
1. Parameter Validation and Setup:
    + Checks if the specified start is greater than the end, which would be an error.
    + Ensures that a `stepSize` is defined unless `bed_regions_list` is provided, indicating specific regions to count over.
    + Initializes an array, `subnum_reads_per_bin`, to store read counts for each bin.
2. BAM File Handling:
    + Opens each BAM file specified in `self.bamFilesList`. Handles exceptions gracefully and logs system exits.
3. Blacklist Handling:
    + If a blacklist file is provided, it loads the blacklist regions using the GTF format. These regions will be skipped in the coverage calculation.
4. Region Preparation:
    + Determines the regions (transcripts) to consider based on the `bed_regions_list` if provided, or calculates them based on the `stepSize` and `binLength`. This setup allows for dynamic determination of the regions based on user input or file data.
5. Coverage Calculation for Each Region:
    + Iterates over each BAM file and each calculated region. For each region, it calls `get_coverage_of_region` to calculate the actual read coverage. This method adjusts for read extensions, skips blacklisted regions, and handles fragmented reads.
    + Accumulates the coverage data into `subnum_reads_per_bin`.
6. Data Saving:
    + If `self.save_data` is true, it opens a temporary file and writes the raw coverage data for each region. This feature is useful for debugging or when detailed raw output is needed.
    + It handles the possibility of bins being smaller at the chromosome ends or due to blacklisted regions by adjusting the output accordingly.
7. Verbose Logging:
    + If verbose mode is enabled, it logs the processing time and throughput (regions per second).

**Return Value:**
- Returns a tuple containing the numpy array of read counts (subnum_reads_per_bin) and possibly a filename where raw data is saved.

**Important Notes:**
- Blacklisting: Effectively skips regions specified in a blacklist, ensuring that these regions do not contribute to the coverage calculations.
- Dynamic Region Calculation: Allows for flexible handling of genomic regions, whether defined by a BED file, step sizes, or explicit region lists.
- Temporary File Handling: Optionally writes out detailed coverage data to a temporary file for further analysis or verification.

This method is part of a larger framework designed to handle large-scale genomic datasets efficiently, using parallel processing to speed up computations. The integration with other components (like `bamHandler` and `GTF`) suggests a well-structured approach to genomic data analysis, emphasizing flexibility, efficiency, and accuracy in coverage computation.

The `get_coverage_of_region` function in the `CountReadsPerBin` class from deepTools calculates the coverage of genomic regions based on read data from BAM files. This method is intricate, incorporating various features such as handling extended reads, accounting for blacklisted regions, and dealing with paired-end data correctly. Here's a detailed breakdown of what each part of the method does:

**Overview**  
This method generates a coverage vector for specified genomic regions by iterating over reads from a BAM file. The coverage is calculated by counting reads overlapping with each genomic "tile" (bin), defined by the input regions.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown**
1. Initialization:
    + Fragment Function: Sets the default method to determine the boundaries of a read or fragment if not provided.
    + Coverage Array: Initializes an array to store the coverage data. The size depends on the number and size of the regions provided.
2. Parameter Adjustments:
    + Determines the length to extend reads based on whether the default fragment length is set to read length or a specified value.
3. Blacklist Handling:
    + Loads blacklisted regions if provided, which will be used to exclude certain genomic regions from the analysis.
4. Region Setup:
    + Prepares the regions to process. Adjusts the regions for the read extension and handles blacklisted regions to avoid fetching reads from these regions.
5. BAM File Processing:
    + Loops through each provided BAM file handle:
        - Fetches reads from the BAM file within the adjusted region.
        - Filters reads based on their mapping quality, flags for inclusion/exclusion, duplication, and fragment size.
        - Adjusts read data for paired-end and extended reads.
        - Coverage Calculation:
            + For each read, determines the blocks (positions) the read covers, adjusting for fragment boundaries.
            + Adds coverage to the appropriate bins based on the overlap of read blocks with the defined regions.
6. Coverage Compilation:
    + Accumulates coverage across all reads and regions, adjusting indices for overlapping and adjacent regions and handling situations where bins are smaller due to region ends or blacklisting.
7. Data Handling and Output:
    + Optionally writes out detailed raw data to a file.
    + Outputs extensive logging information if verbose mode is enabled.
8. Return Value:
    + Returns the coverage data as a numpy array.

**Key Functionalities and Computations**
- Handling of Extended Reads: Accounts for the physical coverage of fragments rather than just the read positions, which is critical for accurately reflecting the genomic coverage, especially in ChIP-seq or other similar assays where the actual DNA fragment sizes are relevant.
- Blacklisting: Effectively ignores regions that are typically problematic or contain artifacts, ensuring that these do not skew the coverage calculations.
- Flexible Region Handling: Can process arbitrary genomic regions as specified by the user, accommodating both uniform binning across a region and specific, user-defined genomic intervals.
- Robust Read Filtering: Incorporates sophisticated filtering to exclude low-quality reads, duplicates, and reads not meeting specific biological or experimental criteria, thereby improving the accuracy of the coverage calculation.

This method is part of a comprehensive suite of tools in deepTools designed for high-throughput genomic analysis, emphasizing flexibility, efficiency, and biological relevance in coverage calculations.

Certainly! Let's break down the get_coverage_of_region method line by line for a detailed understanding:

**Function Declaration**
```python
def get_coverage_of_region(self, bamHandle, chrom, regions, fragmentFromRead_func=None):
```
- `bamHandle`: The BAM file handler used to fetch reads.
- `chrom`: The chromosome from which to fetch the reads.
- `regions`: A list of tuples defining the start and end positions of the regions for which coverage is to be calculated.
- `fragmentFromRead_func`: Optional function to determine how to handle reads; defaults to a method that determines read coverage based on fragment sizes.

**Initial Setup**
```python
if not fragmentFromRead_func:
    fragmentFromRead_func = self.get_fragment_from_read
```
- Sets the default function for handling read fragments if none is provided.
- `#NOTE` Need to understand how `get_fragment_from_read` works

**Coverage Array Initialization**
```python
nbins = len(regions)
if len(regions[0]) == 3:
    nbins = 0
    for reg in regions:
        nbins += (reg[1] - reg[0]) // reg[2]
        if (reg[1] - reg[0]) % reg[2] > 0:
            nbins += 1
coverages = np.zeros(nbins, dtype='float64')
```
- Calculates the number of bins needed based on the regions provided. If regions have a third value, it indicates the size of the bin.
- Initializes a numpy array coverages to store the coverage count for each bin.

**Extension Length Determination**
```python
if self.defaultFragmentLength == 'read length':
    extension = 0
else:
    extension = self.maxPairedFragmentLength
```
- Determines the length by which reads should be extended; if default fragment length is just the read length, no extension is applied.

**Blacklist Handling**
```python
blackList = None
if self.blackListFileName is not None:
    blackList = GTF(self.blackListFileName)
```
- Loads a GTF file containing blacklisted regions if provided. These regions will be excluded from coverage calculation.

**Region Processing Loop**
```python
vector_start = 0
for idx, reg in enumerate(regions):
    tileSize = int(reg[2]) if len(reg) == 3 else int(reg[1] - reg[0])
    nRegBins = (reg[1] - reg[0]) // tileSize
    if (reg[1] - reg[0]) % tileSize > 0:
        nRegBins += 1
```
- Initializes `vector_start` for indexing into the coverage array.
- For each region, calculates the number of bins (`nRegBins`) and the size of each bin (`tileSize`).

**Read Fetching and Filtering**
```python
regStart = int(max(0, reg[0] - extension))
regEnd = reg[1] + int(extension)
for read in bamHandle.fetch(chrom, regStart, regEnd):
    if read.is_unmapped or self.minMappingQuality and read.mapq < self.minMappingQuality or \
       self.samFlag_include and read.flag & self.samFlag_include != self.samFlag_include or \
       self.samFlag_exclude and read.flag & self.samFlag_exclude != 0:
        continue
```
- Adjusts region start and end based on the extension.
- Fetches reads from the BAM file within the extended region.
- Filters out reads based on mapping quality, unmapped status, and SAM flags.

**Coverage Calculation**
```python
position_blocks = fragmentFromRead_func(read)
for fragmentStart, fragmentEnd in position_blocks:
    if fragmentEnd is None or fragmentStart is None or fragmentEnd <= reg[0] or fragmentStart >= reg[1]:
        continue
    sIdx = vector_start + max((fragmentStart - reg[0]) // tileSize, 0)
    eIdx = vector_start + min(np.ceil(float(fragmentEnd - reg[0]) / tileSize).astype('int'), nRegBins)
    coverages[sIdx:eIdx] += 1
```
- Calls the function to get fragment start and end positions for each read.
- Filters out fragments not overlapping the current region.
- Calculates start and end indices for coverage increments in the coverages array based on the fragment positions.

**Clean-up and Return**
```python
if self.verbose:
    endTime = time.time()
    print("%s,  processing %s (%.1f per sec) reads @ %s:%s-%s" % (multiprocessing.current_process().name, c, c / (endTime - start_time), chrom, reg[0], reg[1]))
```
- If verbose mode is enabled, prints processing statistics.

**Return Coverage Data**
```python
return coverages
```
- Returns the coverage array, which contains coverage data for each bin across the specified regions.

This method accurately calculates the read coverage for specified genomic regions while handling paired-end reads, extended reads, and regions that should be excluded due to blacklisting or other criteria. It demonstrates a comprehensive approach to genomic data analysis, considering many of the complexities involved in dealing with high-throughput sequencing data.

Please give a line-by-line breakdown of what is happening in this function, which is part of the class `countReadsPerBin`:

<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
    def get_fragment_from_read(self, read):
        """Get read start and end position of a read.
        If given, the reads are extended as follows:
        If reads are paired end, each read mate is extended to match
        the fragment length, otherwise, a default fragment length
        is used. If reads are split (give by the CIGAR string) then
        the multiple positions of the read are returned.
        When reads are extended the cigar information is
        skipped.

        Parameters
        ----------
        read: pysam object.

        The following values are defined (for forward reads)::

        The function returns the fragment start and end, either
        using the paired end information (if available) or

Sure, let's dissect the `get_fragment_from_read` method line by line, which is quite crucial for understanding how fragments from sequencing reads are handled and extended in genomic analysis.

**Function Declaration**
<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
def get_fragment_from_read(self, read):
```
</details>
<br />

- Purpose: Calculate the start and end positions of a fragment represented by a sequencing read.
- Parameter: `read` - a pysam object representing a single read from a BAM file.

**Early Return for Non-Extended Reads**
<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
if self.defaultFragmentLength == 'read length':
    return read.get_blocks()
```
</details>
<br />

- Condition: If `defaultFragmentLength` is set to `'read length'`, this indicates no extension of reads beyond their actual length is to occur.
- Action: Return the list of tuples representing the actual aligned blocks of the read from the BAM file (handles spliced reads).

**Determination of Fragment Start and End**
<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
else:
    if self.is_proper_pair(read, self.maxPairedFragmentLength):
        if read.is_reverse:
            fragmentStart = read.next_reference_start
            fragmentEnd = read.reference_end
        else:
            fragmentStart = read.reference_start
            fragmentEnd = read.reference_start + abs(read.template_length)
```
</details>
<br />

- `#NOTE` Need to break down `is_proper_pair`.
- Condition: If the read is a properly paired (meaning it and its mate are correctly oriented and positioned according to the sequencing protocol).
- Action:
    + For reverse reads: Set `fragmentStart` to the start of the mate and `fragmentEnd` to the end of the current read.
    + For forward reads: Set `fragmentStart` to the start of the read and calculate `fragmentEnd` by adding the insert size to the start (this assumes the template length covers the entire fragment).

**Extension for Single-End or Improperly Paired Reads**
<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
else:
    if read.is_reverse:
        fragmentStart = read.reference_end - self.defaultFragmentLength
        fragmentEnd = read.reference_end
    else:
        fragmentStart = read.reference_start
        fragmentEnd = read.reference_start + self.defaultFragmentLength
```
</details>
<br />

- Condition: Applies if the read is not part of a proper pair or if single-end reads are being analyzed.
- Action:
    + For reverse reads: Extend backwards from the end of the read by `defaultFragmentLength`.
    + For forward reads: Extend forwards from the start of the read by `defaultFragmentLength`.

**Optional Read Centering**
<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
if self.center_read:
    fragmentCenter = fragmentEnd - (fragmentEnd - fragmentStart) / 2
    fragmentStart = int(fragmentCenter - read.infer_query_length(always=False) / 2)
    fragmentEnd = fragmentStart + read.infer_query_length(always=False)
```
</details>
<br />

- Condition: If `center_read` is `True`, this attempts to center the read or fragment around the midpoint between its start and end.
- Action:
    + Calculate the center of the fragment.
    + Adjust the `fragmentStart` and `fragmentEnd` so that the read is centered around this midpoint, based on the inferred query length of the read.

**Assertion for Validity**
<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
assert fragmentStart < fragmentEnd, "fragment start greater than fragment end for read {}".format(read.query_name)
```
</details>
<br />

- Purpose: Ensure that the calculated start of the fragment is less than the end, which is a basic sanity check to catch potential errors in fragment calculations.

**Return Fragment Coordinates**
<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
return [(fragmentStart, fragmentEnd)]
```
</details>
<br />

- Output: Returns a list containing a single tuple with the start and end coordinates of the fragment.

This function effectively handles both paired and single-end reads, considers extensions for fragment lengths, and optionally centers reads within their calculated fragments. It's crucial for accurately calculating coverage and other genomic metrics based on the actual biological fragments represented by sequencing reads.

Let's analyze the `is_proper_pair` method line by line. This method is designed to determine whether a read from a paired-end sequencing run is correctly paired with its mate based on certain biological and technical criteria.

**Function Declaration**
<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
def is_proper_pair(read, maxPairedFragmentLength):
```
</details>
<br />

- Purpose: Checks if a sequencing read is part of a properly paired end, adhering to various criteria.
- Parameters:
    + `read`: A `pysam` read object, which contains data about a single read from a BAM file.
    + `maxPairedFragmentLength`: The maximum allowed distance between paired reads for them to be considered properly paired.

**Early Returns for Invalid Conditions**
<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
if not read.is_proper_pair:
    return False
```
</details>
<br />

- Check: Utilizes the `is_proper_pair` flag from the BAM file's SAM flags to quickly determine if the read is marked as improperly paired. If it's marked as false, the function returns `False` immediately.

<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
if read.reference_id != read.next_reference_id:
    return False
```
</details>
<br />

- Check: Ensures that both reads of the pair are aligned to the same chromosome. If they're on different chromosomes, the function returns `False`.

<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
if abs(read.template_length) > maxPairedFragmentLength:
    return False
```
</details>
<br />

- Check: Ensures the absolute distance between the reads (given by `template_length`, which is the insert size) does not exceed the `maxPairedFragmentLength`. This condition filters out abnormally long fragments that might be indicative of mapping errors or structural variants.

**Orientation Checks**
<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
if read.is_reverse is read.mate_is_reverse:
    return False
```
</details>
<br />

- Check: Verifies that the reads are not facing the same direction. For a proper pair, one read should be forward and the other reverse. If both are in the same orientation, it returns `False`.

**Positional Checks**
<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
if read.is_reverse:
    if read.reference_start >= read.next_reference_start:
        return True
else:
    if read.reference_start <= read.next_reference_start:
        return True
```
</details>
<br />

- Logic: Depending on whether the read is mapped to the reverse strand:
    + For reverse reads: The function checks if the start of the current read is greater than or equal to the start of its mate. Since reverse reads are sequenced from the other end, a proper pair would have the reverse read starting later or at the same position as its mate.
    + For forward reads: The start of the read should be less than or equal to the start of its mate. This is because forward reads are sequenced from the 5' end and thus should start before the reverse read in a proper pair setup.

**Final Return**
<details>
<summary><i>Python code</i></summary>

```python
return False
```
</details>
<br />

Default Case: If none of the earlier conditions are met for determining a proper pair based on orientation and position, the function defaults to returning False.

This function effectively filters out reads that do not meet the expected criteria for properly paired reads, crucial for ensuring data integrity in downstream analyses like variant calling, fusion detection, and structural variant discovery.

### On a quick and straightforward way to randomly downsample a BAM file
<details>
<summary><i>Me</i></summary>
<br />

What's a quick and straightforward way to randomly downsample a BAM file (in order to have a smaller file for running tests)?
</details>
<br />

<details>
<summary><i>GPT4</i></summary>
<br />

Downsampling a BAM file to a smaller size for testing purposes can be efficiently done using tools like `samtools`. The `samtools view` command includes options for subsampling reads, which can help you create a smaller, more manageable file size for testing and development.

Here's how you can do it:

**1. Using Samtools View**  
To downsample a BAM file randomly, you can use the -s option with samtools view. The -s option takes a fraction in the form of a seed and a probability (e.g., 0.25 for 25% of the data).

*Example command:*
```bash
samtools view -b -s 42.25 input.bam > downsampled.bam
```
+ `-b` ensures the output is in BAM format.
+ `-s 42.25` sets the seed to `42` and the sampling fraction to `25%`. You can adjust the `25` to another number if you want a different fraction (e.g., `42.10` for `10%`).

**2. Install Samtools**  
If you don't have samtools installed, you can typically install it via a package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use:

```bash
sudo apt-get install samtools
```

Or, if you use Conda, you can install it using:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda samtools
```

**3. Check the Output**  
After downsampling, it's good practice to check the resulting BAM file to ensure it contains the expected number of reads. You can do this with:

```bash
samtools view -c downsampled.bam
```

This command counts the number of reads in the downsampled BAM file.

Using `samtools` for downsampling is effective because it allows you to quickly generate smaller files without the need for extensive computational resources, making it ideal for testing and development phases of your projects.

#### On the need to filter for "properly paired" alignments when randomly downsampling a BAM file
<details>
<summary><i>Me</i></summary>
<br />

If I randomly subsample a BAM file with `samtools view`, e.g., via...
```bash
    samtools view \
        -@ "${threads}" \
        --subsample "${samp_frac}" \
        --subsample-seed "${samp_seed}" \
        "${bam_init}" \
        --output "${bam_down}"
```

then do I need to filter for properly paired reads and perform `samtools fixmate`, etc. again?

Or should I include `-f 2` in the above call to `samtools view` when I perform downsampling? Then afterwards, run `samtools fixmate`, etc. (that is, `samtools sort -n` followed by `samtools fixmate` followed by `samtools sort` (without `-n`) followed by `samtools index`)?
</details>
<br />

<details>
<summary><i>GPT4</i></summary>
<br />

When you randomly subsample a BAM file using `samtools view`, it's possible that some read pairs may become incomplete because only one mate of a pair might be selected in the downsampling process. This can lead to issues if your downstream analyses depend on complete and properly paired reads.

**Steps for Handling Subsampled Data:**  
*1. Including Proper Pairs During Subsampling:*  
To reduce the chance of getting incomplete pairs in the first place, you can include the -f 2 flag in your samtools view command during subsampling. This flag ensures that only properly paired reads are considered for subsampling, helping maintain the integrity of read pairs:
```bash
samtools view \
    -@ "${threads}" \
    -f 2 \
    --subsample "${samp_frac}" \
    --subsample-seed "${samp_seed}" \
    "${bam_init}" \
    -o "${bam_down}"
```

*2. Fixing Mate Information:*  
Even with the `-f 2` filter, it's a good practice to check and fix any potential issues with mate information post-subsampling. This is where `samtools fixmate` comes in:
- Sort by Name: Necessary to ensure that mates are adjacent in the file for samtools fixmate to work effectively.
```bash
samtools sort -n -@ "${threads}" -o "${bam_down_sorted_by_name}" "${bam_down}"
```
- Fixmate: This corrects mate-related fields in the BAM file, which might be incorrect after subsampling.
```bash
samtools fixmate -m "${bam_down_sorted_by_name}" "${bam_down_fixed}"
```
- Sort by Coordinate: To prepare the BAM file for most downstream analyses and indexing.
```bash
samtools sort -@ "${threads}" -o "${bam_down_sorted_by_coord}" "${bam_down_fixed}"
```
- Index the BAM File: To facilitate faster access and analysis by various bioinformatics tools.
```bash
samtools index "${bam_down_sorted_by_coord}"
```

*3. Why Fixmate After Subsampling?*  
Even if you use `-f 2`, subsampling can disrupt some expected information in BAM files, especially if you are working with paired-end data where integrity of mate information is crucial. `samtools fixmate` ensures that the flags and fields related to paired-end information are corrected after manipulation of the BAM file.

**Conclusion:**  
By including `-f 2` in your initial subsampling step, you reduce the need for extensive clean-up but do not eliminate it completely, especially in a pipeline expecting rigorous data integrity. Following up with `samtools fixmate` and other steps ensures that your data remains consistent and suitable for downstream processes.

Do BAM files need to be queryname-sorted prior to running them through `samtools fixmate`?
</details>
<br />

<details>
<summary><i>GPT4 (with edits by me)</i></summary>
<br />

Yes, for `samtools fixmate` to work correctly, the BAM file needs to be sorted by queryname. This sorting ensures that each mate in a read pair is adjacent to each other in the file, which is necessary because `samtools fixmate` operates on consecutive reads with the assumption that they are paired together. When reads are sorted by queryname, the tool can efficiently check and update the mate information (like mate coordinates and flags) directly from one read to the next.

Here’s why this is important:

1. Paired-end Information Correction: `samtools fixmate` examines each read and its next consecutive read to correct mate-related information. If the file is not sorted by queryname, mates might not be adjacent, and `samtools fixmate` may either fail to correct the information or, worse, corrupt the file by mismatching read pairs.
2. Efficiency: Processing a queryname-sorted file allows `samtools fixmate` to process reads sequentially without needing to search through the entire file to find matching mates, making the correction process much faster and less memory-intensive.

If your BAM file is initially coordinate-sorted or unsorted, you would typically perform a sorting step using `samtools sort -n` prior to running `samtools fixmate`. Here's how you can do it:
```bash
samtools sort -n -o output.qnamesorted.bam input.bam
samtools fixmate -m output.qnamesorted.bam output.fixmate.bam
samtools sort -o output.final.bam output.fixmate.bam  # Optional: Re-sort by coordinates
samtools index output.final.bam  # Optional: Index the coordinate-sorted BAM file
```

This sequence ensures that the mate information is corrected properly, potentially following up with coordinate sorting and indexing for most downstream applications that require coordinate-sorted BAMs.

**The following answer from GPT4 is wrong.**

<details>
<summary><i>GPT4</i></summary>
<br />

Let's break down the meaning of the SAM flags and illustrate how reads with flags 83/163 and 99/147 are aligned on the reference genome. The SAM flags indicate various properties of the alignment, such as whether the read is paired, whether it is mapped in a proper pair, the orientation of the read, and the order of the reads in the pair.

**Understanding Flags 83 and 163:**
- Flag 83: This flag indicates that the read is the first in a pair (64), is paired and properly mapped (1 and 2), mapped to the reverse strand of the reference (16), and its mate is on the forward strand (32). [*Note: "and its mate is on the forward strand (32)"&mdash;this is wrong.*]
- Flag 163: This flag indicates that the read is the second in a pair (128), is paired and properly mapped (1 and 2), mapped to the forward strand of the reference (32 reversed in the description but should be 16 for read's own strand), and its mate is on the reverse strand (16). [*Note: "mapped to the forward strand of the reference (32 reversed in the description but should be 16 for read's own strand)"&mdash;this is wrong.*]

**Visual Representation of Flags 83 and 163:**
```txt
Reference: 5' -----------------------------> 3'
           3' <----------------------------- 5'

Read with flag 83 (first in pair, reverse strand):
           5' --------------------<========= 3'
Mate with flag 163 (second in pair, forward strand):
           3' =========>-------------------- 5'
```

**Understanding Flags 99 and 147:**
- Flag 99: This flag indicates that the read is the first in a pair (64), is paired and properly mapped (1 and 2), mapped to the forward strand of the reference (32 for mate on reverse strand, but should be 16 for own strand), and its mate is on the reverse strand (16).
- Flag 147: This flag indicates that the read is the second in a pair (128), is paired and properly mapped (1 and 2), mapped to the reverse strand of the reference (16), and its mate is on the forward strand (32).

**Visual Representation of Flags 99 and 147:**
```txt
Reference: 5' -----------------------------> 3'
           3' <----------------------------- 5'

Read with flag 99 (first in pair, forward strand):
           5' =========>-------------------- 3'
Mate with flag 147 (second in pair, reverse strand):
           3' --------------------<========= 5'
```

This configuration shows that the first read (flag 99) is aligned to the forward strand, pointing towards the right, while its mate (flag 147) is aligned to the reverse strand, pointing towards the left.

**Summary:**
In both pairs, the reads are aligned inwardly towards each other, which is typical for properly paired reads in DNA sequencing where fragments are sequenced from both ends towards the middle. The use of "Read reverse strand" and "Mate reverse strand" in the table helps determine which strand each read of the pair is mapped to, and also indicates the directionality of each read with respect to the reference genome.

> The use of "Read reverse strand" and "Mate reverse strand" in the table helps determine which strand each read of the pair is mapped to, and also indicates the directionality of each read with respect to the reference genome.

So, if I see "Read reverse strand" associated with a flag for a given read, I am to understand that its mate is on the forward strand?
</details>
<br />

**Again, this answer from GPT4 is wrong.**

<details>
<summary><i>GPT4</i></summary>
<br />

Actually, when you see "Read reverse strand" in relation to a SAM flag, it specifically means that the read itself, not its mate, is aligned to the reverse strand of the reference genome. This designation is a direct descriptor of the read in question, not its mate. Similarly, "Mate reverse strand" indicates that the mate of the read (the other half of the pair) is aligned to the reverse strand.

Here's how to interpret these designations:
- Read reverse strand: The read itself is on the reverse strand.
- Mate reverse strand: The mate of the read is on the reverse strand.

For example, in the case of:
- Flag 83: The description includes "Read reverse strand," which tells you that this read (first in the pair) is aligned on the reverse strand.
- Flag 163: Includes "Mate reverse strand," implying the mate of this read (second in the pair and described by another flag) is on the reverse strand, but since Flag 163 is describing the second read which itself is on the forward strand, it tells you about the orientation of the first read in the pair.

If a flag indicates "Mate reverse strand," this means the mate (the other read in the pair) is aligned to the reverse strand. Therefore, if your read has a flag indicating it is on the reverse strand (e.g., "Read reverse strand"), it does not imply anything directly about its mate's alignment from that piece of information alone; you would need to check the mate's flag or the flag description specifically mentioning the mate's orientation to determine this.

> If a flag indicates "Mate reverse strand," this means the mate (the other read in the pair) is aligned to the reverse strand.

There is no FLAG information that explicitly specifies alignment to the forward strand&mdash;only the reverse strand. In your own answer above, you show the following, suggesting that we can infer forward strand status of an accompanying mate in a read pair based on the descriptor for the reverse strand (either "Mate reverse strand" or "Read reverse strand") :
```txt
Reference: 5' -----------------------------> 3'
           3' <----------------------------- 5'

Read with flag 83 (first in pair, reverse strand):
           5' --------------------<========= 3'
Mate with flag 163 (second in pair, forward strand):
           3' =========>-------------------- 5'

Read with flag 99 (first in pair, forward strand):
           5' =========>-------------------- 3'
Mate with flag 147 (second in pair, reverse strand):
           3' --------------------<========= 5'
```

Hence my question: So, if I see "Read reverse strand" associated with a flag for a given read, I am to understand that its mate is on the forward strand?

<br />

What does "mate reverse strand" and "read reverse strand" mean? Does it actually have to do with the strandedness of the library? I think not because one can pair-end sequence libraries from non-stranded NGS protocols.
</details>
<br />

<details>
<summary><i>GPT4</i></summary>
<br />

You're correct that "mate reverse strand" and "read reverse strand" in SAM flags do not directly relate to the strandedness of the library in terms of RNA-seq library protocols (stranded vs. non-stranded). Instead, these flags specifically address the physical orientation of the reads relative to the reference genome in paired-end DNA sequencing, regardless of whether the library is stranded.

Here’s a breakdown of what these terms mean:

1. Read reverse strand (flag 16): This flag is set when the read itself is aligned to the reverse complement of the reference sequence. This means the sequence of the read in the file is the reverse complement of the sequence in the reference. It doesn't imply anything about RNA or DNA strand-specific transcription, only the alignment orientation of the read.
2. Mate reverse strand (flag 32): This flag indicates that the mate of the given read (the other read in the paired-end relationship) is aligned to the reverse complement of the reference sequence. It does not necessarily say that the mate's sequence in the file is reverse complemented because that depends on how the data was processed and aligned; it just describes the alignment orientation of the mate relative to the reference.

**Application in paired-end reads:**  
- In paired-end sequencing, each fragment of DNA is sequenced from both ends, giving two reads: one forward and one reverse. These reads are expected to map facing each other and pointing towards one another on the reference. This is important for proper alignment validation and helps in determining insert sizes and detecting structural variants, among other applications.

**Stranded vs. Non-stranded Libraries:**  
- In RNA-seq, stranded libraries allow you to determine which DNA strand the RNA transcript was made from, but this is different from what the SAM flags tell you.
- The "read reverse strand" and "mate reverse strand" flags could appear in any sequencing library type (including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, etc.), purely indicating the directionality of the read in relation to the reference genome.

In short, these flags are essential for understanding how reads align to the reference genome in terms of direction and orientation, which is critical for accurate genome assembly, variant calling, and other genomic analyses. They help in determining the proper alignment and orientation of the reads but do not inform about the transcriptional directionality in terms of RNA synthesis unless the library prepared was specifically stranded.

<br />

In paired-end sequencing, each fragment of DNA is sequenced from both ends, giving two reads: one forward and one reverse. When "properly paired," these reads are expected to align to a reference genome facing each other and pointing towards one another with respect to the reference.

When properly paired, the reads that comprise pairs will have one of the four following SAM flags: 83 (0x53), 163 (0xA3), 99 (0x63), or 147 (0x93). These SAM flags contain information on "mate reverse strand" (flag 16/0x10) or "read reverse strand" (flag 32/0x20).

My question is this: "mate reverse strand" (flag 16/0x10) or "read reverse strand" (flag 32/0x20) do not directly relate to the strandedness of the library in terms of library protocols (e.g., stranded vs. non-stranded); instead, they simply indicate the directionality of the read in relation to the reference genome—is that correct? That is, "mate reverse strand" means that a given alignment is considered "the mate" in a read pair and is the reverse complement of the sequence in the reference; "read reverse strand" means that a given alignment is considered "the read" in a read pair and is the reverse complement of the sequence in the reference. Is my understanding correct? If not, please help me understand.

If set, each read is extended~~,~~ without exception. *NOTE*: This feature is generally [not] recommended for spliced-read data~~,~~ such as RNA-seq, as it would extend reads over skipped regions. *Single-end*: Requires a [user-specified] value for the final fragment length. Reads that already exceed this fragment length will not be extended. *Paired-end*: Reads with mates are always extended to match the fragment size defined by the two read mates. Unmated reads, [read mates] that [align] too far apart (>4$\times$ fragment length), [read mates that align] to different chromosomes are treated like single-end reads. The input of a fragment length value is optional. If no value is specified, it is estimated from the data ([as the] mean of the fragment size of all [read mates]).

See [here](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/feature/read_extension.html) for the source information.

In the majority of NGS experiment[s], DNA (or RNA) is fragmented into small stretches and only the ends of these fragments [are] sequenced. For many applications, it's desirable to quantify coverage of the entire original fragments over the genome. Consequently, there is an `--extendReads` option present throughout deepTools. This works as follows:

**Paired-end reads**  
1. Regions of the genome are sampled to determine the median fragment/read length.
2. The genome is subdivided into disjoint regions. Each of these regions comprises one or more bins of some desired size (specified by `-bs`).
3. For each region, all alignments overlapping it are gathered. [Additionally], all alignments within [2,000] bases are gathered, as [2,000] bases is the maximum allowed fragment size.
4. The resulting collection of alignments are all extended according to their fragment length, which for paired-end reads is indicated in BAM files.
    + For singletons, the expected fragment length from step 1 is used.
5. For each of the extended reads, the count in each bin that it overlaps is incremented.

**Single-end reads**  
1. An extension length, `L`, is specified.
2. The genome is subdivided into disjoint regions. Each of these regions comprises one or more bins of some desired size (specified by `-bs`).
3. For each region, all alignments overlapping it are gathered. [Additionally], all alignments within [2,000] bases are gathered, as [2,000] bases is the maximum allowed fragment size.
4. The resulting collection of alignments are all extended to length `L`.
5. For each of the extended reads, the count in each bin that it overlaps is incremented.

**Blacklisted regions**  
The question likely arises as to how alignments originating inside of blacklisted regions are handled. In short, any alignment contained completely within a blacklisted region is ignored, regardless of whether it would extend into a non-blacklisted region or not. Alignments only partially overlapping blacklisted regions are treated as normal, as are pairs of reads that span [across] a blacklisted region. This is primarily for the sake of performance, as otherwise each extended read would need to be checked to see if it overlaps a blacklisted region.

> 1. Regions of the genome are sampled to determine the median fragment/read length.
How many and at what size?

> 2. The genome is subdivided into disjoint regions. Each of these regions comprises one or more bins of some desired size (specified by `-bs`).
Given the meaning of "disjoint" as "having no elements in common," the quoted text would be interpreted as follows: "The genome is divided into separate, non-overlapping regions. Each of these regions consists of one or more bins of a specified size (determined by `-bs`)." This interpretation implies that each region is distinct and does not overlap with any other region, and these regions are further divided into smaller units called bins.

Hello all,

I am using an older version of deepTools[,] 1.5.9, and as per [the documentation of bamCoverage](https://github.com/fidelram/deepTools/wiki/Normalizations)[.]

Given a BAM file, this tool generates a bigWig or bedGraph file of fragment or read coverages. The way the method works is by first calculating all the number[s] of reads (either extended to match the fragment length or not) that overlap each bin in the genome. Bins with zero counts are skipped, i.e.[,] not added to the output file. The resulting read counts can be normalized using either a given scaling factor, the RPKM formula[,] or to get a 1x depth of coverage (RPGC). In the case of paired-end mapping[,] each read mate is treated independently to avoid a bias when a mixture of concordant and discordant pairs is present. This means that each end will be extended to match the fragment length.

What does the last line exactly mean? Will each [mate] from a set of paired-end reads be extended individually and counted as [two] fragments? And the [single-ended reads] (orphan reads) [will] be extended to [the] mean fragment size inferred from [the] other paired-end reads?

As of now, I am planning to move to the newer version (2.2.4), and the documentation does not include the last line mentioned above. So, [could] I assume that in the newer version, when `bamCoverage` is presented with a BAM file of mixed reads (paired-end and orphan reads), it will only extend the paired-end [reads] to fragments and not the [single-end reads]? It will be nice to get a clarification on this.

Thanks,  
Aarthi

Hi Aarthi[,]

Read extension to paired-end fragment size was enabled by default in deepTools-1.5.9, meaning all reads are extended to match fragment size, doesn't matter whether it has a mate [(sic)] mapped or not.

In deepTools2[,] read extension is disabled by default, meaning no read will be extended to match the fragment size. If you want read [extension]s, you can turn on [the] `--extendReads` option.

For more details for deepTools2, check out the bamCoverage documentation [here](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/bamCoverage.html).

Hi Vivek,

Thanks for the response. Yes, I understand that in the older version[,] read extension is enabled by default. 

My main concern is how ~~is~~ the read extension to fragments [is] done, especially for a BAM file with mixed reads (paired-end and single/orphan reads). 

In the previous versions' documentation as highlighted below,  
> In the case of paired-end mapping[,] each read mate is treated independently to avoid a bias when a mixture of concordant and discordant pairs is present. This means that each end will be extended to match the fragment length.

Does it mean that each end of the paired-end is separately extended to a fragment size? 

I would expect the the paired-end reads to be extended from `mate1_start` to `mate2_end` and get counted once.

Thanks,  
Aarthi

That's right. Each read is extended independently to match the fragment length, and when you add [the] [`--normalizeUsing RPKM`] option, each read is counted independently[.]

Note that when you use RPKM, all reads (and not fragments) are counted. This doesn't depend on read extension. Read extension only affects how the signal is distributed in bins. If you don't extend [paired-end] reads, that signal won't [be] spread in some empty [bins that lie] between the two mates.

Hi Vivek,

So, is it correct to say that [`bamCoverage`] will always count the paired-reads twice? 

I am trying to generate a [bigWig] file for fragment pileup (without RPKM normalisation),  and [I] expect the fragment to be counted only once (so, paired-end reads after extension will be counted once, and single-end reads extended to mean fragment size [will be] counted once). 

If I use [the] `--samFlagInclude` option to filter [for the] first mate, then those single-end reads where only `mate2` [was aligned] will be lost. 

I did my mapping with Bowtie2, and have filtered my BAM file for alignments with [a minimum] MAPQ [of] 10, [concordant] pairs (`YT:Z:CP`) and [single-mapped] reads (`YT:Z:UP`). 

Thanks for your help!

Pairs will be counted twice in a bin if you use extend the reads, but you should check if you really need read [extension] for RNA-seq since you start to see signals on introns etc. Usually with [non-overlapping] pairs and [a] small bin size, you count a mate only once in a bin.

If you have filtered the [BAM] file and wish to count pairs only once, you can first fix the mates after filtering (`samtools fixmate`), then use the option `--samFlagExclude`/`--samFlagInclude` to keep one of the pairs. I think this should give you what you want. But you should check the BAM file and `bigWig` files to make sure it worked (and let us know)[.]

Yes, they are not counted.

For us, the default option of deepTools to count every read is the best solution to this mixture of [paired-end and single-end reads]. 

What type of data do you have?

The way deepTools handles this seems weird to me. Essentially, paired-end reads are counted twice when calculating coverage?

The way Brad does it&mdash;if I understand correctly&mdash;is to obtain the fragment length for each pair and then calculate coverage from that&mdash;from piling up the data.

I should continue to read up on and study how deepTools handles paired-end reads when calculating coverage (by default, reads are not extended), then either submit a question for clarification to Biostars and/or send one to Brad. I should also review the difference between deepTools and "typical" coverage using their two different methods. If I try the `fixmate`/`--samFlagInclude` approach with deepTools, will I get "typical coverage"?

Hi Fidel,

I have [RNAPII ChIP-seq data]. My initial notion was to extend paired-end reads to fragments (counting as [one]) and single-end reads to mean fragment size (counting as [one]), and obtain a fragment pileup.

So, manually I generated fragments and did a profile plot with `python`. But, I think there is no huge difference between ~~a~~ read-based (no extension) and fragment-based plots.

So, I think the default settings of `bamCoverage`/`bamCompare` should be fine.

I have another query regarding the `--sortRegions` in `computeMatrix` and `plotHeatmap`.

When I use [four] score files (bigWig) to generate the matrix for a single BED file, and then use `plotHeatmap` with `--sortRegions`, will the order of the genes in the four groups in [the] heatmaps be [the] same?

> 1. Paired-End Reads: If the reads are paired-end, each read in the pair is typically extended to the expected fragment length. This fragment length could be predetermined (like a standard 200 bp for certain DNA-seq libraries) or calculated from the data (e.g., using the median fragment length observed in the dataset).
>     + Forward Read: The extension will start from the read's starting position (5' end) and extend rightwards.

>     + The goal is to cover the entire fragment that was sequenced, assuming that the read might not cover it entirely due to sequencing limitations.

Does this mean that there will end up being two equal-sized extended reads representing each fragment?

For example, for a properly paired set of forward and reverse reads,
```txt

     |--          -- read.tlen --              --|
     |-- read.alen --|
-----|===============>--------------------------------
     |               |
read.reference_start
            read.reference_end

                                read.pnext
```

...will become the following?
```txt

     |--          -- read.tlen --              --|
                     |--    amount extended    --|
     |-- read.alen --|

```

<br />

**The following answer from GPT4 is incorrect.**
<details>
<summary><i>GPT4</i></summary>
<br />

Yes, your interpretation is mostly correct, but let's clarify a couple of details to ensure accuracy:

**Extended Reads in Paired-End Sequencing**
In paired-end sequencing, each fragment of DNA is sequenced from both ends, resulting in two reads: one forward and one reverse. These are typically not as long as the entire DNA fragment, so extending reads can help cover the whole fragment that was originally sequenced.

**How Reads are Extended**
- Forward Read (Read 1): This read is extended from its 3' end (the end of the read) rightwards. The extension is done to cover the expected fragment length.
- Reverse Read (Read 2): This read is extended from its 5' end (the start of the read) leftwards, again to cover the expected fragment length.

**Visualization of Extended Reads**
Let's visualize your example with a more detailed explanation:

*Original Reads:*
```txt
Fragment:          |<----------------------Fragment Length---------------------->|
Read 1 (Forward):  |--Read1---> 
Read 2 (Reverse):                                 <---Read2--| 

Positions:         |--------|--------------------------------|------------------|
                   Start of Read1                   End of Read2
                   (read.reference_start)           (read.pnext)
```

*Extended Reads:*
```txt
Fragment:          |<----------------------Fragment Length---------------------->|
Read 1 (Extended): |--Read1---------------------------------------------------->|
Read 2 (Extended): <----------------------------------------------------Read2--| 

Positions:         |--------|--------------------------------|------------------|
                   Start of Read1                   End of Read2
                   (read.reference_start)           (read.pnext)
```

**Important Points**
1. Extension Length: The length to which each read is extended depends on the expected or calculated fragment length minus the actual read length.
2. Non-Overlapping Extensions: Ideally, the extensions of Read 1 and Read 2 should meet or slightly overlap in the middle of the fragment, but they do not create two equal-sized extensions that cover the entire fragment independently. Rather, each read is extended enough to cover the gap that its sequencing did not reach, assuming that both reads together should encompass the entire original DNA fragment.
3. Proper Pair Criteria: For proper pair alignment, the reads should face each other with Read 1 aligned towards the 5' to 3' direction and Read 2 aligned towards the 3' to 5' direction, essentially bracketing the DNA fragment they come from. This orientation is crucial for correctly extending the reads to cover the full fragment.

In summary, while the reads are extended to cover the fragment length, they are not independently extended to the full length of the fragment but rather just enough to ensure complete coverage when combined. The visualization and explanation you provided are on point for understanding how the extension aims to reconstruct the entire fragment from the paired reads.

> Pairs will be counted twice in a bin if you use extend the reads, but you should check if you really need read [extension] for RNA-seq since you start to see signals on introns etc. Usually with [non-overlapping] pairs and [a] small bin size, you count a mate only once in a bin.

> Vivek  

In my BAM file of interest, I have already performed the "fixing" of mates via `samtools fixmate` (via the method we discussed in a recent back-and-forth). Moreover, prior to running `samtools fixmate`, I filtered the BAM file with `samtools view --require-flags 2`, ensuring that only reads with mates are in the BAM file.

My question for you is this: What FLAG should I use with `bamCoverage --samFlagInclude` so that only one of the two mates that make up the read pairs is retained?

I am thinking that this will be my baseline call to `bamCoverage`:
```bash
bamCoverage \
    --bam "${bam}" \
    --outFileName "${bam%.bam}.${region}.bamCoverage.${format}" \
    --outFileFormat "${format}" \
    --binSize "${bin_size}" \
    --region "${region}" \
    --numberOfProcessors "${threads}" \
    --normalizeUsing "${normalization}" \
    --effectiveGenomeSize "${genome_size}" \
    --minMappingQuality "${min_MAPQ}"
```

So, `--samFlagInclude` with a FLAG number needs to be added to the above call. What FLAG number?
</details>
<br />

<details>
<summary><i>GPT4</i></summary>
<br />

For `bamCoverage` to include only one mate of a pair in your analysis, you can use the SAM flag filtering options provided by `bamCoverage`. In particular, you can use `--samFlagInclude` to specify which reads should be included based on their flag settings.

If you want to include only the first mate of each pair, you can use the flag `0x40`. This flag represents the first mate in a paired-end read. Here’s how the flag works:
- `0x40` in hexadecimal corresponds to `64` in decimal, which is the SAM flag for the first mate in a properly paired read.

You should modify your `bamCoverage` command by adding `--samFlagInclude 64` to ensure that only the first mate of each read pair is counted:
<details>
<summary><i>Bash code</i></summary>

```bash
bamCoverage \
    --bam "${bam}" \
    --outFileName "${bam%.bam}.${region}.bamCoverage.${format}" \
    --outFileFormat "${format}" \
    --binSize "${bin_size}" \
    --region "${region}" \
    --numberOfProcessors "${threads}" \
    --normalizeUsing "${normalization}" \
    --effectiveGenomeSize "${genome_size}" \
    --minMappingQuality "${min_MAPQ}" \
    --samFlagInclude 64
```
</details>
<br />

This setup will ensure that only the first mate of each pair is considered for coverage calculations, reducing the likelihood of double-counting areas covered by both mates. If your dataset or specific analysis requires considering the second mate instead, you would use `0x80` (or `128` in decimal), which is the flag for the second mate in a read pair.

Including this flag effectively filters the reads before coverage calculation, making your analysis more focused and potentially more accurate for your specific needs.

## Refactoring `calculate_coverage.py` to take BAM infiles
<details>
<summary><i>Me</i></summary>
<br />

I want to write a version of the following script that makes use of `pysam` to take in a BAM infile rather than a BED file. The BAM file will have been processed to contain only "proper pairs" of alignments (e.g., those with FLAGs `99`, `147`, `83`, or `163`), and it will have been "corrected" with `samtools fixmate`, so all reads will have correct `TLEN` values; the infile will have been coordinate-sorted as well. Either the first alignment in the pair (FLAG `64`) or second alignment in the pair (FLAG `128`) should be retained (I'll leave it to you to decide), and upon retention, new processing code should appropriately make use of the TLEN value to extend the remaining read to its fragment length. Care to take a stab at this, carefully explaining what you did and why?

To convert the provided script for handling BED files into one that processes BAM files using pysam, we'll need to make several significant adjustments. I'll walk you through each step and explain why these changes are necessary:

1. *Library Changes and Handling BAM Files:* We'll switch from processing BED files to handling BAM files. This will require the use of the `pysam` library to read BAM files directly.
2. *Data Extraction from BAM Files:* Instead of reading start and end positions directly from a BED file, we'll compute them based on the aligned read positions in the BAM file, considering the `TLEN` value to determine the extent of the read fragment.
3. *Selection of Read Pairs:* As you specified retaining either the first or second alignment in each proper pair, we'll focus on reads with FLAGs `83` or `163` to represent the first alignment of the pair. This choice avoids redundancy since these FLAGs indicate reads that are mapped in the proper pair and are the first segment in the template.
4. *Extension Using `TLEN`:* Since `TLEN` represents the template length, we'll extend the read to cover the entire fragment length as indicated by the absolute value of `TLEN`.
5. *Modifications to Coverage Calculation:* The coverage calculation will now use reads extended to their fragment length rather than fixed start and end positions.
Here is how the updated Python script looks:
